# 🌟 15 Days of CSS – My HTML + CSS Learning Journey

Welcome to my **15-day CSS learning and revision journey**!  
This repository documents my commitment to practicing and improving my **core CSS skills** by building one **HTML + CSS-only project** every single day — no JavaScript, no frameworks, just clean, responsive, real-world CSS.

---

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

As part of becoming a stronger frontend developer, I want to:
- Revisit the **foundations of CSS**
- Practice layout techniques like **Flexbox** and **Grid**
- Improve design consistency, responsiveness, and reusability
- Build a habit of **daily hands-on learning**
- Create a valuable reference repo for future use

---

## 🔍 What You'll Find in This Repo

- 📅 **15 folders** — one for each day of learning
- 💡 Each folder contains:
  - A **focused HTML + CSS project**
  - Clean, readable code
  - Optional: a README with notes and a screenshot
- 🔧 No JavaScript — pure CSS practice
- 📚 Topics covered: Box Model, Flexbox, Grid, Positioning, Responsive Design, Typography, Variables, Transitions, Animations, and more
